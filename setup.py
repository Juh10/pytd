"""Treasure Data Driver for Python

pytd is a Python interface to Treasure Data data management platform. Unlike
td-client-python, the official Treasure Data API library for Python, pytd gives
a direct access to their back-end query and storage engines. The seamless
connection allows your Python code to read and write a large volume of data in
a shorter time. It eventually makes your day-to-day data analytics work more
efficient and productive.
